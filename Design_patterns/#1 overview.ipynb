    "+ #### Abstract Factory \n",
    "    - Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ #### Adapter \n",
    "    - Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Makes classes work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ #### Bridge \n",
    "    - Decouple an [abstraction](#jump1) from its implemetation so that the two can vary independently.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ #### Builder\n",
    "    - Seperate the constraction of a complex object from its [representation][2] so that the same construction process can create different representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ #### Chain of Responsibility \n",
    "    - Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its reciever by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the recieving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ #### Command \n",
    "    - Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ #### Composite \n",
    "    - Compose objects into tree structures to represnet part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.\n",
    " \n",
    "+ #### Decorator \n",
    "    - Attach additional resposibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ #### Facade \n",
    "    - Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem Facade defines a high level interface that make the subsystem easier to use.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ #### Factory Method\n",
    "    - Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiated. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ #### [Flyweight][3]\n",
    "    - Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.\n",
    "   \n",
    "+ #### Interpreter \n",
    "    - Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that use the representation to interpret sentence in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ #### Iterator\n",
    "    - Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing to its underlying representation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ #### Mediator \n",
    "    - Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from refering each other explicitly, and it let you vary their interaction independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ #### Memento \n",
    "    - Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+  #### Observer \n",
    "    - Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automaticlly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ #### Prototype \n",
    "    - Specific the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.\n",
    " \n",
    "+ #### Proxy \n",
    "    - Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ #### Singleton\n",
    "    - Ensure a class only have one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.\n",
    " \n",
    "+ #### State\n",
    "    - Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class[?].\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ #### Strategy \n",
    "    - Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy let the algorithm vary independently from the client that use it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ #### Template method\n",
    "    - Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, defering some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ #### Visitor \n",
    "    - Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor let you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.\n",

    "<span id = \"jump1\"></span>\n",
    "**Encapsulation** is a way to achieve \"information hiding\" so, following your example, you don't \"need to know the internal working of the mobile phone to operate\" with it. You have an interface to use the device behaviour without knowing implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** on the other side, can be explained as the capability to use the same interface for different objects. Different implementations of the same interface can exist. Details are hidden by encapsulation."
