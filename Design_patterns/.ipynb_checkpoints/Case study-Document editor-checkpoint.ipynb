    "##### Document structure\n",
    "1. Needs: \n",
    " 1. Maintaining the document's physical structure\n",
    " 2. Generating and presenting the document visually\n",
    " 3. Mapping positions on the display to elements in the internal representation \n",
    "2. Pattern: Composite Pattern\n",
    "Using recursive composition can represent any poteintially complex, hierachical structure.\n",
    "        \n",
    "##### Formatting\n",
    "    1. Needs: Supporting different formatting algorithms.\n",
    "    2. Pattern: Strategy pattern\n",
    "        a. let the client use algorithms through a interface.\n",
    "        b. let algorithms get the context through the interface.\n",
    "        \n",
    "##### Embellishing user interface\n",
    "1. Needs: Add different affects when visualizing the documents, and don't mess with the document structures in the same time.\n",
    "2. Patterns: Decorator\n",
    "By using **transparent enclosure**, decorator pattern add responsibilities to the original object without making different to the user of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Supporting multiple look-and-feel standard\n",
    "1. Needs: Creating diffrent styles of objects for same purpose. Easy replacement.\n",
    "2. Pattern: Abstract Factory\n",
    "Using a abstract class as an interface to create objects. Using subclasses to instantiating different styles of objects."
