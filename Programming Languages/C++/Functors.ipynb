    ">A functor is pretty much just a class which defines the operator(). That lets you create objects which \"look like\" a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "// this is a functor\n",
    "struct add_x {\n",
    "  add_x(int x) : x(x) {}\n",
    "  int operator()(int y) const { return x + y; }\n",
    "\n",
    "private:\n",
    "  int x;\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "// Now you can use it like this:\n",
    "add_x add42(42); // create an instance of the functor class\n",
    "int i = add42(8); // and \"call\" it\n",
    "assert(i == 50); // and it added 42 to its argument\n",
    "\n",
    "std::vector<int> in; // assume this contains a bunch of values)\n",
    "std::vector<int> out(in.size());\n",
    "// Pass a functor to std::transform, which calls the functor on every element \n",
    "// in the input sequence, and stores the result to the output sequence\n",
    "std::transform(in.begin(), in.end(), out.begin(), add_x(1)); \n",
    "assert(out[i] == in[i] + 1); // for all i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ">There are a couple of nice things about functors. One is that unlike regular functions, they can contain state. The above example creates a function which adds 42 to whatever you give it. But that value 42 is not hardcoded, it was specified as a constructor argument when we created our functor instance. I could create another adder, which added 27, just by calling the constructor with a different value. This makes them nicely customizable."
